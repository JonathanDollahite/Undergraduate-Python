# Undergraduate-Python

A collection of projects completed as a junior at the United States
Naval Academy in the Spring of 2021. Professor Nate Chambers
in the computer science department taught 
SI286, Programming for Everyone. I had some prior experience in Python and HTML from several courses in the Cyber Science Department, but this course inspired me to continue programming at the graduate level.

The Course syllabus (with instructions for all labs and the final project) is found at the link below:
